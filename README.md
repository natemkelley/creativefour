# Jeopardy Application

### This application was my first attempt using Node.Js to create an application

##### The project works like this:
- User sends and points earned to server
- Server processes if answer was correct and how many points the user has
- Client receives answers from server and recalculates points

#### I found the API that I was using has incredibly hard answers so it is possible to console.log the correct answer.
